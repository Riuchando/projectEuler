(combinations items n) - A lazy sequence of all the unique
ways of taking n different elements from items.
Example: (combinations [1 2 3] 2) -> ((1 2) (1 3) (2 3))

(subsets items) - A lazy sequence of all the subsets of
items (but generalized to all sequences, not just sets).
Example: (subsets [1 2 3]) -> (() (1) (2) (3) (1 2) (1 3) (2 3) (1 2 3))

(cartesian-product & seqs) - Takes any number of sequences
as arguments, and returns a lazy sequence of all the ways
to take one item from each seq.
Example: (cartesian-product [1 2] [3 4]) -> ((1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4))
(cartesian-product seq1 seq2 seq3 ...) behaves like but is
faster than a nested for loop, such as:
(for [i1 seq1 i2 seq2 i3 seq3 ...] (list i1 i2 i3 ...))

(selections items n) - A lazy sequence of all the ways to
take n (possibly the same) items from the sequence of items.
Example: (selections [1 2] 3) -> ((1 1 1) (1 1 2) (1 2 1) (1 2 2) (2 1 1) (2 1 2) (2 2 1) (2 2 2))

(permutations items) - A lazy sequence of all the permutations
of items.
Example: (permutations [1 2 3]) -> ((1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 1 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2) (3 2 1))
Example: (permutations [1 1 2]) -> ((1 1 2) (1 2 1) (2 1 1))

(partitions items) - A lazy sequence of all the partitions
of items.
Example: (partitions [1 2 3]) -> (([1 2 3])
                                  ([1 2] [3])
                                  ([1 3] [2])
                                  ([1] [2 3])
                                  ([1] [2] [3]))
Example: (partitions [1 1 2]) -> (([1 1 2])
                                  ([1 1] [2])
                                  ([1 2] [1])
                                  ([1] [1] [2]))
Example: (partitions [1 1 2 2] :min 2 :max 3) -> (([1 1 2] [2])
                                                  ([1 1] [2 2])
                                                  ([1 1] [2] [2])
                                                  ([1 2 2] [1])
                                                  ([1 2] [1 2])
                                                  ([1 2] [1] [2])
                                                  ([1] [1] [2 2]))

About this code:
These combinatorial functions can be written in an elegant way using recursion.  However, when dealing with combinations and permutations, you're usually generating large numbers of things, and speed counts.  My objective was to write the fastest possible code I could, restricting myself to Clojure's functional, persistent data structures (rather than using Java's arrays) so that this code could be safely leveraged within Clojure's transactional concurrency system.

I also restricted myself to algorithms that return results in a standard order.  For example, there are faster ways to generate cartesian-product, but I don't know of a faster way to generate the results in the standard nested-for-loop order.

Most of these algorithms are derived from algorithms found in Knuth's wonderful Art of Computer Programming books (specifically, the volume 4 fascicles), which present fast, iterative solutions to these common combinatorial problems.  Unfortunately, these iterative versions are somewhat inscrutable.  If you want to better understand these algorithms, the Knuth books are the place to start.

;;;;; Partitions - Algorithm H

; The idea in Algorithm H is to find the lexicographic "growth string" vectors, mapping each index
; in 0..N-1 to the partition it belongs to, for all indices in 0..N-1.
; Example: for the partition ([0 2] [1] [3]), the corresponding growth string would be [0 1 0 2].

; The rule for each growth string L is that for each i in 0..N-1,
; L[i] <= max(L[0] ... L[i-1]) + 1

; During the course of the algorithm, I keep track of two vectors, a and b.
; For each i in 0..N-1, a[i] = L[i], and b[i] = max(L[0] ... L[i-1]) + 1.

; "r" is the maximum partition count, and "s" is the minimum. You can also think of these as being
; the bounds of the maximum number in each growth string.

;;;;;; Partitions - Algorithm M

; In Algorithm M, the idea is to find the partitions of a list of items that may contain duplicates.
; Within the algorithm, the collections are stored as "multisets," which are maps that map items
; to their frequency. (keyval pairs with a value of 0 are not included.) Note that in this algorithm,
; the multisets are not stored as maps, but all multisets are stored together across multiple vectors.

; Here is what the internal vectors/variables will look like when the algorithm is visiting the
; partition ([1 1 2 2 2] [1 2] [1]):

; c[i] =      1 2|1 2|1
; v[i] =      2 3|1 1|1
; u[i] =      4 4|2 1|1
; ---------------------------
;    i =      0 1 2 3 4 5
; f[x]=i:     0   1   2 3
; l = 2
; n = 8
; m = 2

; You can think of (c,v) and (c,u) as the (keys,vals) pairs of two multisets.
; u[i] represents how many c[i]'s were left before choosing the v values for the current partition.
; (Note that v[i] could be 0 if u[i] is not 0.)
; f[x] says where to begin looking in c, u, and v, to find information about the xth partition.
; l is the number of partitions minus one.
; n is the total amount of all items (including duplicates).
; m is the total amount of distinct items.

; During the algorithm, a and b are temporary variables that end up as f(l) and f(l+1).
; In other words, they represent the boundaries of the "workspace" of the most recently written-out partition.
